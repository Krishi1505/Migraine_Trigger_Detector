## Migraine_Trigger_Detector

Migraines affect millions of people worldwide, often triggered by various factors like food, stress, sleep patterns, weather, or screen time. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can analyze patterns from user data and predict potential migraine triggers, helping individuals take preventive action.

# Problem Statement
Migraines are triggered by a wide variety of personal and environmental factors. It is difficult for individuals to identify these patterns manually. This project uses machine learning to predict migraine likelihood based on collected data and identify top contributing factors to help users understand the triggers better.

# Dataset
Attention please! : Our project doesn't include real user data for privacy
This model will be trained on a synthetic dataset that simulates daily logs including:

- Sleep hours
- Water & caffeine intake
- Stress level
- Screen time
- Physical activity
- Weather (temperature, humidity)
- Migraine occurrence (target variable)

# ML Approach
We will use various models including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (Best accuracy)
